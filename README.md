# DYI-Replacement-Motormount-for-ELEV-8
Files for making your own [replacement motor mounts for the Parallax ELEV-8 drone](https://www.parallax.com/product/721-80304)

###Crash!

You've just crashed your Parallax ELEV-8 drone testing some new code. The motormounts are smashed. Of course it is Friday night, so even 
if you paid for overnight shipping, you are grounded at least for the next 5 days. What do you do?

###Make your own replacement motor mounts!

If you have a laser cutter or CNC milling machine (I assume you do if you are writing drone code), then you can make your own 
replacement motor mounts with the files in this repo. 

###Orginal file

This is the SolidWorks model that Parallax generously supplies...
